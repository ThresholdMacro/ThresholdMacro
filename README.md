## About Me

I am a financial market analyst and developer with a keen interest in creating data-driven tools to analyze and visualize market dynamics. My work focuses on providing clear, actionable insights into complex financial data, with a particular emphasis on repo markets and derivatives positioning.

I leverage my expertise in financial analysis and web development to build interactive dashboards and monitors that track key market indicators.

## Projects

Here are some of the web-based financial data applications I have developed:

The tool visualizes recent rate history, aiding in the analysis of short-term funding market trends.
