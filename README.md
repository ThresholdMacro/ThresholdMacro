## About Me

I am a financial market analyst and developer with a keen interest in creating data-driven tools to analyze and visualize market dynamics. My work focuses on providing clear, actionable insights into complex financial data, with a particular emphasis on repo markets and derivatives positioning.

I leverage my expertise in financial analysis and web development to build interactive dashboards and monitors that track key market indicators.

## Projects

Here are some of the web-based financial data applications I have developed:

### 📊 Repo Rate Monitor
* **Live Site:** [https://host1.hedge-analytics.com/Repo/](https://host1.hedge-analytics.com/Repo/)
* **Description:** An interactive dashboard for monitoring key US repo rates, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), Broad General Collateral Rate (BGCR), and Tri-Party General Collateral Rate (TGCR). The tool visualizes recent rate history, aiding in the analysis of short-term funding market trends.

### 📈 Commitment of Traders (COT) Analyzer
* **Live Site:** [https://host1.hedge-analytics.com/COTR/](https://host1.hedge-analytics.com/COTR/)
* **Description:** This application provides a detailed visualization of the CFTC's Commitment of Traders report. It allows users to explore the positioning of different categories of traders (e.g., asset managers, leveraged funds) across a variety of futures contracts, offering insights into market sentiment and potential turning points.

### 📋 DTCC GCF Repo Daily Snapshot
* **Live Site:** [https://host1.hedge-analytics.com/DTCCDashboard/](https://host1.hedge-analytics.com/DTCCDashboard/)
* **Description:** A daily dashboard presenting a snapshot of the DTCC's General Collateral Finance (GCF) repo market. The tool displays data on transaction volumes, rates, and other key metrics for both GCF and tri-party repo, providing a comprehensive overview of daily activity in this critical funding market.
